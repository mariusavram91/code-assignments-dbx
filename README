# Dropbox assignments

An app where an applicant can drop their assignments, which are then saved in a
shared directory in Dropbox. It gives a quick overview of all the available
assignments.

```
export DROPBOX_TOKEN='<VALUE_HERE>'

virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 env &&
source ./env/bin/activate &&
pip install -r requirements.txt &&
./manage.py syncdb &&
./manage.py migrate &&
./manage.py runserver &&

```
